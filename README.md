# RIAR

RIAR Is A Raytracer, written fully in C#. Yet we can complain of this unusual technological choice, this basic ray-tracer application is meant to be comprehensive, safe and highly adaptable to any further modification. That is probably because I prefer C# to C++ though.

Currently provided as a Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 solution, fully written in C# .NET Core 2.2.
To use it:

1- Adapt your scene in `Program.cs` file in the `RTIOWCS_Console` project.
2- Compile and launch the project !

Output is provided as a .ppm file.
