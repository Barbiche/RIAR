# RIAR
RIAR Is A Raytracer. Everything is said.
Highly inspired from Peter Shirley's MAGNIFICENT collection on raytracing. However this one is in C#.

Features:
 - Spheres.
 - Simple materials: lambertian diffuse, basic Metals and buggy dielectrics.
 - Simple camera (not matrix based, what a shame).
 - Defocus blur.
 - MSAA.

This project is clearly for personal education, however feel free to add suggestions!
